Ghost comes with a best-in-class editor which does its very best to get out of the way, and let you focus on your content. Don't let its minimal looks fool you, though, beneath the surface lies a powerful editing toolset designed to accommodate the extensive needs of modern creators.

For many, the base canvas of the Ghost editor will feel familiar. You can start writing as you would expect, highlight content to access the toolbar you would expect, and generally use all of the keyboard shortcuts you would expect.

Our main focus in building the Ghost editor is to try and make as many things that you hope/expect might work: actually work.

- You can copy and paste raw content from web pages, and Ghost will do its best to correctly preserve the formatting.
- Pasting an image from your clipboard will upload inline.
- Pasting a social media URL will automatically create an embed.
- Highlight a word in the editor and paste a URL from your clipboard on top: Ghost will turn it into a link.
- You can also paste (or write!) Markdown and Ghost will usually be able to auto-convert it into fully editable, formatted content.

The goal, as much as possible, is for things to work so that you don't have to _think_ so much about the editor. You won't find any disastrous "block builders" here, where you have to open 6 submenus and choose from 18 different but identical alignment options. That's not what Ghost is about.

What you will find though, is dynamic cards which allow you to embed rich media into your posts and create beautifully laid out stories.
